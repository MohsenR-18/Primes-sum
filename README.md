# Problem
Given a number N. Find if it can be expressed as sum of two prime numbers.

# Example 1:
<b>Input</b>: N = 34 <br>
<b>Output</b>: "Yes" <br>
<b>Explanation</b>: 34 can be expressed as <br>
sum of two prime numbers.<br>

# Example 2:
<b>Input</b>: N = 23 <br>
<b>Output</b>: "No" <br>
<b>Explanation</b>: 23 cannnot be expressed as 
sum of two prime numbers. <br>

# Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. <br> Complete the function isSumOfTwo() which takes N as input parameter and returns "Yes" if can be expressed as sum of two prime numbers. else return "No". <br>

<b>Expected Time Complexity</b>: O(N*sqrt(N)) <br>
<b>Expected Auxiliary Space</b>: O(1) <br>

# Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
