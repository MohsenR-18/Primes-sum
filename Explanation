Before starting to write a solution, you need to pay attention to three things:

. If the N equals to (1, 2 , 3), then return "No"
. Every even number can be expressed as sum of two prime numbers
. If the N is odd, do as follow

# Odd numbers
If the N is an odd number, first of all subtract 2 from N 
and pass the result as an argument to "isPrime()" method.

Second make a for loop that the "i" goes from 2 to (the square root of N plus one).

Third make a condition inside for loop which checks if the reminder of N(the N-2 passed to "isPrime()" method)
divided by "i" is either equal to zero or not. 
(if yes, then return "No", cause the N can't be expressed as sum of two prime numbers)

Finally if Nothing happened and you reached the end of for loop, return "yes" cause the N can be expressed as sum of two prime numbers.
